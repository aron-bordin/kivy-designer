Hi!


In this week I developed some extra features to **Kivy Designer** not listed in my proposal. In the firsts weeks I made a good advance on my proposal, so now I have some times to add some important features to the project.

Check the video with some of this features working:

### Better Python Code Input - Jedi

Something completely **essential to any IDE is autocompletion**. In this extra-feature, I had added some improvements to the Python Code Input. 
Now it's possible to **change the theme**, it shows the **line number** on the left, and the most important one: **Jedi integration**.


### Jedi - an awesome autocompletion/static analysis library for Python

Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors. 
Its historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as well. 
Jedi is fast and is very well tested. 
It understands Python on a deeper level than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.


### Next week

#### Kivy Console

The current version of Kivy Console(a terminal emulator on Kivy Designer) have some bugs, it's not compatible with Python 3 and it's getting slower with long processes. 
Now I'm analyzing to check what is the best: fix some parts, or rewrite this Widget.

#### PRs

I have 3 PRs waiting review and some branchs waiting r+ from these PRs.



Thats it, thanks for reading :)
