Hi!

In the next week, I'm going to start the **Kivy Designer development**, I'm very excited about it :)

I'd like to list my goals with this project, and how you can help me to create a good version. 

## My proposal

I'll be working in a more stable and useful version of Kivy Designer. I'll be fully **integrated with Hanga, Buildozer and Git** to help the development process. In these integrations, I hope to work on an **IDE that can make mobile development with Python easy.**

The Kivy Designer interface is not completely user friendly, some tasks, editing a .kv file or a buildozer spec file sometimes can be boring. I hope to improve it.


Actually the Kivy Designer has no tutorials neither documentation. So I'll create some **guides and examples to show to new developers how to get started with this IDE.**

I have a big list of open issues to work in the next months, [you can read this list here](https://github.com/aron-bordin/kivy-designer/issues).

And to release a really good version, I'll need your help :)

## Can you help me?

Kivy Designer is not yet a powerful IDE, so I'll need your help with it :)
Take a look on how you can help me:

* Have you found a bug? 
	* Please, I know that it has a lot of bugs now, but the best way to help me with it is reporting.
* Is there something missing on Kivy Designer?
	* I really need more **ideas**. If you'd like to see any kind of **new feature** on Kivy Designer, please, just let me know.
* Should it be different?
	* If you don't like how something works on Kivy Designer or you just fell uncomfortable about something, please, just let me know.
* **Do you have an idea??**
	* **I love ideas. Share it with me :)**
* Contributions are always welcome:)
	* Kivy projects has a big and helpful community. If you are interested, contributions are always welcome :)
