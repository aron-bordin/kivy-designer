Hello everyone!

This is the first post of the blog. This afternoon I have been accepted into Google Summer of Code 2015! This is a perfect news!

I have some goals, and I want to release a more stable version of Kivy Designer at the end of this summer. [You can check the version under development right here](http://github.com/aron-bordin/kivy-designer)

In this blog I'll be posting the development process weekly, some tips about new features and about kivy!


So, see you soon :)
