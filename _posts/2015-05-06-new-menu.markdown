Hello everyone!

KD will have some new features, so I'm going to adjust the menu. I just draw some of my ideas, it can change well I start the development. 
This new menu will help us to handle new build options, as Buildozer and Hanga, with some Run profiles. 
You can take a look in this photo:

<a target="_blank" href="{{ "/assets/uploads/new_menu.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/uploads/new_menu_small.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="max-width: 600px" >
</a>
