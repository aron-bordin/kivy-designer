Hello everyone!

I'll be using this first week to learn more the Kivy Designer source code. It's not easy to understand completely, I'm going to get an ideia on how it works and learn about intern processes to be able to add new features and fix bugs. 


#### Logs
To keep all the development process well documented, I'll always open a new pull request to describe the bug, create a new branch to each bug, on in this branch and well it's ok and tested, merge into master. Using this methodology it's really easier to trace a log about my development.

#### Issues

Now I created a list of issues that I'm going to work in this Google Summer of Code. [Check this list here.](https://github.com/aron-bordin/kivy-designer/issues)

#### Milestones

I have some milestones too, you can check these [milestones here](https://github.com/aron-bordin/kivy-designer/milestones).
